# Aelin Vision

## Product Name

Aelin

## One-liner

Aelin is a signal-native chat agent that continuously tracks your interest boundaries, stores evidence over time, and supports deep conversations grounded in your own data stream.

## Core Positioning

- Not another general chat UI.
- Not a one-shot web-search answer bot.
- A persistent personal signal memory agent.

## Product Shift

- Previous center: Desk-first message board.
- New center: Chat-first agent workspace.
- Desk becomes an auxiliary surface for verification and exploration.

## The Key Differentiator

Most chat agents do: query -> fetch -> answer.

Aelin does: define interest boundaries -> continuously collect -> persist -> structure timeline -> answer with evidence -> update long-term memory.

## User Promise

When discussing a new topic, Aelin can reason from continuously accumulated personal signal history rather than a one-time retrieval snapshot.

## Non-goals for v1

- Replacing all existing dashboard workflows.
- Multi-tenant team features.
- Full automation of external actions.
